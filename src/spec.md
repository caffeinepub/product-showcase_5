# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a commercial product catalog website with WhatsApp contact integration and an admin panel for product management.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a public product catalog displaying products in a responsive grid with images, names, descriptions, and prices
- Add WhatsApp contact buttons on each product that open WhatsApp with pre-filled product details
- Enable public browsing without any authentication or sign-up requirements
- Create an admin panel protected by Internet Identity for adding, editing, and deleting products
- Implement backend CRUD operations for products with persistent storage
- Design with warm, earthy color palette (terracotta, sage green, cream) and elegant typography

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse products and contact via WhatsApp instantly. Admin can manage the product catalog through a secure admin panel using Internet Identity authentication.
