  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive admin dashboard with analytics and metrics, including backend query methods (getTotalProducts, getTotalOrders, getPendingOrdersCount, getLowStockCount, getTotalRevenue), custom React hooks for each statistic, a dashboard page displaying metric cards and recent orders, and navigation links from both AdminPanel and Header. All requirements appear to be implemented with appropriate admin authorization checks, loading states, and design consistency.",
